# StableSweep 60-Second Demo Script

StableSweep helps DeFi traders decide not just *where* to route, but *whether to execute now*.

First, we fetch a live quote and route.
Then we compute a decision score using execution-relevant factors like impact, slippage settings, and route complexity.
From this, the app outputs a clear recommendation: **Buy now**, **Reduce size**, or **Wait**, with a plain-language reason.

This is useful because existing routing tools often stop at quote output, while traders still need a timing and risk decision.

Now I run our judge scenario preset.
You can see the recommendation update instantly, along with trend and provider status context.

Finally, the chart view provides market movement context so the recommendation is not shown in isolation.

In short: StableSweep is decision intelligence on top of routing, focused on practical execution quality.
